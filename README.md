TableEditor
===========

Simple JS UI for editing tables.

Works in FF, Chrome, & Safari. Haven't tested Opera or IE9 yet, but it is my
intention to ensure that both work well.

### Todo

*	IE9, Opera support
*	A real bug shakedown
*	Support in the core as well as in the UI for colspan/rowspan
	(shown to user as 'merged cells'.)
*	Keyboard accessibility
*	Switch UI positioning to use coordinate transform between absolute and fixed
	positioning modes rather than the spaghetti gymnastics the code does now.
